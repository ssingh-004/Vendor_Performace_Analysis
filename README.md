# Vendor_Performace_Analysis

1.Project Overview:
Retail businesses often struggle to maintain profitability when dealing with multiple vendors, fluctuating purchase costs, and inefficient stock movement.
This project focuses on transforming scattered vendor & inventory data into a single analysis-ready dataset, followed by building a Power BI dashboard that reveals insights to support smarter vendor management and pricing strategies.

2.Tech and Tools:
MS Excel
Power Query
Power BI Desktop
DAX
Python (Pandas)
Jupyter Notebook
SQL


3.End-to-End Workflow:
3.1. Data Collection:
The original data was distributed across several Excel files, including:
Purchase records
Sales transactions
Inventory stock levels
Product details
Vendor master information
These files contained inconsistencies in formatting and structure, requiring cleaning and consolidation before any meaningful analysis could be performed.

3.2. Dataset Integration:    
Once cleaned, all datasets were merged into a single master table to support streamlined analysis. Key steps included:
Joining datasets using common identifiers such as Product ID and Vendor ID.
Consolidating multiple tables using joins.
Standardizing data types and removing structural redundancies.
This resulted in a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset suitable for building the Power BI dashboard and performing business insights generation.

4..Power BI dashboard with DAX-powered KPIs:
Core Metrics
Total Revenue
Total Gross Profit
Profit Margin %
Inventory Turnover
Unsold Inventory Capital

5..Key Business Insights:
Majority purchases depend on top 10 vendors → Supply chain risk identified.
High-margin brands lack sales so they need promotional boost.
Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost by hence leverage volume discounts.
Unsold inventory increases Storage cost and working capital issue.
High sales ≠ High profit → Price & vendor optimization required.
